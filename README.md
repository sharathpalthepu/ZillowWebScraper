# Zillow Web Scraping Project

## Overview
Our aim was to analyze real-estate properties in the Chicago area and determine the correlation between bed types and price along with the affect of location on price.
The scope of this project was for personal use in understanding more about the pricing of different listings and our future goal is to have this be a useful tool for anyone looking at living in Chicago.
